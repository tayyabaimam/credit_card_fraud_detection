# credit_card_fraud_detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It uses a dataset of credit card transactions and employs a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The credit card transaction data is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and prepare it for model training.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** The data is analyzed to understand the distribution of fraudulent and legitimate transactions, identify patterns, and gain insights.
3. **Model Training:** A Logistic Regression model is trained on a balanced dataset using undersampling to address class imbalance.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using accuracy as the performance metric on a separate test dataset.

**Results:**

The model achieves an accuracy of 92% on the test data, demonstrating its ability to effectively detect fraudulent transactions.
